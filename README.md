# Dialectosoar
## Description

An app that helps people learn new languages through watching videos with integrated language understanding and comprehension checks

Watch your language skills soar through the language learning tool that prompts questions based on a YouTube video in any foreign language! Dialectosaur is a webapp that analyzes a video in a foreign language, periodically stopping the video to ask the user a question about the video's content since the last question. In doing so, our app constantly makes sure that user's are staying on top of their language learning while engaging with videos they find interesting!

## Features
1] We offer a variety of question styles to enable learning different specific things, like comprehension questions, multiple choice questions, and writing practice questions

2] We track how many questions a user is getting correct or incorrect, providing specific insights about what their accuracy means and offering a means to improve

3] After a video completes, newly encountered vocabulary words will be added to an ever-growing terms set for the user to practice from! This allows the user to constantly work on expanding their foreign language vocabulary, directly after applying it in context through the video questions

## Software Used
1] YouTube APIs (Subtitle/Transcript Access)
